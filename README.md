In the folders HW1 and HW2 you can find the script for analysing the differential expression of genes between two group of cells. In the **HW1** folder you can find a first version of the program and the short script to preprocess data given in the class. In the **HW2** folder you can find a program version with added option for the multiple hypothesis testing correction. 

Both programs take paths to the *.csv* files, where the columns correspond to different genes, as a input and return *.csv* file with calculated values.
